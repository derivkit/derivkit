name: COCOA
kind: software
description: >
  A cosmological analysis framework that integrates CosmoLike within the Cobaya
  inference engine, enabling forecasts and multi-probe analyses for surveys such
  as DES, LSST, and the Roman Space Telescope.
  COCOA provides a containerized workflow for reproducible inference, ensuring
  consistent compiler and library environments across platforms.
  DerivKit is used internally for derivative-based forecasting and Fisher matrix
  calculations.
