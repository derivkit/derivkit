    "This demo illustrates how to use the helper tools in <code>forecast_kit</code> to facilitate scientific forecasting.\n",

    "The forecasting tools can return a Fisher matrix, and the 3-dimensional and 4-dimensional tensors of the doublet-DALI approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The required inputs are:\n",
    "- **A function defining your observable(s):** This should take as input a single list of parameter values, corresponding to your model parameters. It should return a list of observables. A one-parameter model, or a single observable, should still be structured as a list containing one item.\n",
    "- **The fiducial values of your model parameter(s):** This should likewise be a single list of parameter values. The ordering of the parameters should match the input of your observable function.\n",
    "- **The covariance matrix of the observable(s):** The ordering of the entries in the covariance matrix should match the output of your observable function."
