"""Provides the FiniteDifferenceDerivative class.

The user must specify the function to differentiate and the central value
at which the derivative should be evaluated. More details about available
options can be found in the documentation of the methods.

Typical usage example:

>>>  derivative = FiniteDifferenceDerivative(
>>>    function,
>>>    1
>>>  ).differentiate(order=2)

derivative is the second order derivative of function at value 1.

class FiniteDifferenceDerivative:
    """Computes numerical derivatives using central finite difference stencils.

    This class supports the calculation of first to fourth-order derivatives
    for scalar or vector-valued functions. It uses high-accuracy central
    difference formulas with configurable stencil sizes (3-, 5-, 7-, or 9-point).

    For scalar-valued functions, a single float is returned. For vector-valued
    functions, the derivative is computed component-wise and returned as a
    NumPy array.

    Attributes:
        function: The function to differentiate. Must accept a single
            float and return eithera float or a 1D array-like object.
        x0: The point at which the derivative is evaluated.
        log_file: Path to a file where debug information may be logged.
        debug: If True, debug information will be printed or logged.

    - 3-point: first-order only
    - 5-point: first to fourth-order
    - 7-point: first and second-order
    - 9-point: first and second-order
