"""Core polynomial-fitting utilities used by the adaptive estimator.

All fits are performed in normalized coordinates u, defined by shifting the
abscissae by the expansion point x0 and scaling by the maximum absolute
deviation h so that u ≈ (x − x0) / h ∈ [−1, 1]. Derivatives in x are
recovered from the polynomial in u via the chain rule:
d^m/dx^m = (1 / h^m) * d^m/du^m evaluated at u = 0.

    Shifts samples by ``x0`` and scales by the maximum absolute deviation
    ``h = max(|x − x0|)``. Returns normalized coordinates
    ``u = (x − x0) / h`` and the scale ``h`` (clamped to ``>= 1e-12``).

    The normalization improves numerical stability of polynomial fits and
    provides a simple derivative conversion: if ``p(u)`` fits the data in
    normalized space, then the m-th derivative in the original variable is
    ``p^(m)(0) / h**m``.
