"""Core polynomial-fitting utilities used by the adaptive estimator.

All fits are performed in normalized coordinates. The input values are
shifted by the expansion point and then divided by the maximum absolute
deviation, so that the normalized range is typically between minus one
and one. This normalization improves numerical stability when fitting
polynomials.

Derivatives with respect to the original variable can be recovered from
the fitted polynomial in normalized space by rescaling with the same
normalization factor.
