"""Offset grid builders for adaptive sampling around ``x0``.

This module works with *relative* offsets (around 0). You typically:

1) Start from a small set of strictly positive seed offsets near zero;
2) Mirror them to obtain a symmetric grid about 0 (optionally including 0);
3) If that symmetric grid is too small for a stable fit, extend the positive
   side geometrically until the mirrored grid meets a size target
   (the "required point count").
