    """Scale-aware inverse-distance weights centered at ``x0``.

    Each sample gets a weight based on how far it is from the center point ``x0``.
    To avoid division by zero or overly large weights, we add a small distance
    floor. This floor is chosen as either a fraction of the total spread of points
    or a fixed minimum, whichever is larger. The result is that points closer to
    ``x0`` have larger weights, while those farther away have smaller weights.

    Args:
        x_vals: Sample locations.
        x0: Center location.
        eps_frac: Fraction of the span used to set the distance floor.
        eps_floor: Absolute lower bound for the distance floor.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: Unnormalized weights with shape ``(n_points,)``.
