"""Provides the DerivativeKit API.

This class is a lightweight front end over DerivKit’s derivative engines.
You provide the function to differentiate and the expansion point `x0`,
then choose a backend by name (e.g., ``"adaptive"`` or ``"finite"``).

Adding methods
--------------
New engines can be registered without modifying this class by calling
``register_method`` (see example below).

Examples:
    Basic usage:

        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from derivkit.derivative_kit import DerivativeKit
        >>> dk = DerivativeKit(function=np.cos, x0=1.0)
        >>> # First derivative via the adaptive-fit method:
        >>> # dk.differentiate(method="adaptive", order=1)  # doctest: +SKIP

    Registering a new method:

        >>> from derivkit.derivative_kit import register_method
        >>> from derivkit.some_new_method import NewMethodDerivative
        >>> register_method(
        ...     name="new-method",
        ...     cls=NewMethodDerivative,
        ...     aliases=("new_method", "nm"),
        ... )

Notes:
    - Method names are case/spacing/punctuation insensitive; aliases like
      ``"adaptive-fit"`` or ``"finite_difference"`` are supported when
      registered.
    - For available canonical method names at runtime, call
      ``available_methods()``.
