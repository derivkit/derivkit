"""Provides the DerivativeKit class.

The class is essentially a wrapper for :class:`AdaptiveFitDerivative` and
:class:`FiniteDifferenceDerivative`. The user must specify the function to
differentiate and the central value at which the derivative should be
evaluated. More details about available options can be found in the
documentation of the methods.

Typical usage example:

>>>  derivative = DerivativeKit(function_to_differentiate, 1)
>>>  adaptive = derivative.adaptive.compute()

derivative is the derivative of function_to_differerentiate at value 1.
